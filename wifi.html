    <h1>ChromeOS WiFi Password Extractor</h1>
    <p class="meta-info"><strong>Last updated:</strong> May 29, 2025</p>

    <p>This page provides two tools to help find saved WiFi passwords or configuration details on ChromeOS. Each tool approaches the problem differently and is suited for different scenarios.</p>

    <div class="quick-guide">
        <h3>Quick Guide: Which Tool to Use?</h3>
        <p>Not sure where to start? Hereâ€™s a quick tip:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Tool 1 (Sync Internals Extractor) if:</strong> You're trying to find the password for a WiFi network that uses a simple shared passphrase (like those common in homes, often using WPA2-Personal/PSK authentication) AND you believe ChromeOS might have synced this password with your Google account.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Tool 2 (Network Policy Extractor - NPPE) if:</strong> You suspect the WiFi network details were configured by an administrator via policy (common in schools or businesses), the network uses more complex enterprise authentication (like WPA-EAP), or Tool 1 didn't provide any results. This tool looks for configurations that might be "pushed" to the device as part of its management policies.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="note">
        <p><strong>Important General Note:</strong> The success of these methods heavily depends on your ChromeOS version, how your device is managed by any administrative policies, and the specific type of WiFi network. For many enterprise networks (e.g., those requiring individual user credentials via WPA-EAP with certificates), these tools will likely not reveal a simple user-enterable password but might show other configuration details such as EAP type or server names.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="first-tool-heading">Tool 1: Sync Internals Password Extractor (for Networks Using a Passphrase)</h2>
    <p>This tool is designed to find passphrases for WiFi networks that use a pre-shared key (commonly WPA/WPA2-Personal). It works by examining data that ChromeOS may have synced with your Google account.</p>

    <h4>Technical Explanation: How This Tool Works</h4>
    <p>When you connect to a WiFi network on ChromeOS and are signed into your Google account with sync enabled, certain network configurations can be saved as part of your synced preferences. This often includes details for networks that use a simple passphrase for authentication.</p>
    <p>The <code>chrome://sync-internals</code> page provides a low-level view into this synchronized data. For WiFi networks, the Service Set Identifier (SSID, or WiFi name) is often stored in a hexadecimal (hex) encoded format (or sometimes plain text) as part of a larger key, and the corresponding passphrase is typically stored in a base64 encoded format within a specific JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data structure.</p>
    <p>This tool automates the process by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Guiding you with precise instructions on how to search within <code>chrome://sync-internals</code> (optionally by helping you generate a helper identifier string based on your target SSID for easier visual lookup).</li>
        <li>Allowing you to paste the located JSON data.</li>
        <li>Parsing the JSON to locate the SSID and the base64 encoded passphrase.</li>
        <li>Decoding the passphrase back into a human-readable format and displaying it alongside the decoded SSID.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Step A: Prepare Your Search Term in Sync Internals (Optional but Recommended)</h4>
    <div class="extractor-tool-section">
        <label for="wifi_name_input">Enter SSID (WiFi Name) to get its Hex-Encoded version for searching:</label>
        <input type="text" id="wifi_name_input" placeholder="e.g., MyHomeWiFi (or leave blank)">
        <button id="get_instructions_button">Get Helper ID</button>
        <div class="tool-output-container" style="margin-top:10px;">
            <pre id="sync_search_term_output" style="font-size:0.85em; min-height: 22px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Enter an SSID above then press "Get Helper ID" for Step B.</pre>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Step B: Retrieve Data from <code>chrome://sync-internals</code></h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Open a new tab in your Chrome browser and navigate to <code>chrome://sync-internals</code>.</li>
      <li>Click on the "<strong>Search</strong>" tab located at the top of the page.</li>
      <li>In the search box there, you <strong>must</strong> type <code>wifi_</code> and press Enter. This will populate a list of entries on the left-hand side. These entries are typically in the format <code>[HEXADECIMAL_SSID]&lt;||&gt;psk</code> or sometimes <code>[PLAINTEXT_SSID]&lt;||&gt;psk</code>.</li>
      <li>
        Now, examine the list of entries on the left:
        <ul>
            <li>If you used "Step A" of this tool and it generated a helper identifier string (e.g., <code>4D79486F6D6557694669&lt;||&gt;psk</code>), visually scan the list for this exact string. This string from Step A is for <strong>visual identification only</strong> to help you select the correct entry; you cannot directly search for this full string in this step.</li>
            <li>If you did not use Step A, cannot find a specific generated string from Step A in the list, or are unsure which entry is correct, you may need to try multiple entries. Click on a potential candidate entry on the left, copy its JSON data from the right panel, and use "Step C" of this tool to check if it's the correct network. Repeat this process for other entries if the first one isn't right.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Once you've identified the correct entry in the left-hand list, click on it.</li>
      <li>The full JSON data for that specific entry will appear in the main panel on the right.</li>
      <li>Carefully select and copy <strong>ALL</strong> of the JSON data shown in the right panel (it should start with <code>{</code> and end with <code>}</code>). This is the data you will paste into "Step C" below.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step C: Extract Password with the Tool</h4>
    <div class="extractor-tool-section">
      <label for="sync_data_input">Paste Full JSON Data from <code>chrome://sync-internals</code> Here:</label>
      <textarea id="sync_data_input" placeholder="Paste the entire JSON object for the WiFi network here..."></textarea>
      <button id="extract_password_button_sync">Extract from Sync Data</button>
      <div class="tool-output-container">
        <h4>Output (Sync Internals):</h4>
        <pre id="sync_tool_output">Paste JSON data above and click extract.</pre>
      </div>
    </div>


    <h2>Tool 2: Network Policy Password Extractor (NPPE)</h2>
    <p>This tool attempts to find WiFi configurations by analyzing a network log file (<code>chrome-net-export-log.json</code>). It can be particularly useful if network settings are distributed via administrative policies on managed ChromeOS devices.</p>

    <h4>Technical Explanation: How This Tool Works</h4>
    <p>ChromeOS devices in managed environments (like schools or businesses) often receive their network configurations, including WiFi settings, through policies pushed by an administrator. These policies ensure devices connect to approved networks with specific settings.</p>
    <p>When network events occur or policies are updated, details of these configurations can sometimes be recorded in the comprehensive network logs generated by ChromeOS. The <code>chrome://net-export</code> utility allows users to capture these logs. Critically, selecting the "Include raw bytes" option during log generation is necessary, as policy data containing network configurations is often embedded as a base64 encoded string within the larger JSON log structure.</p>
    <p>The NPPE tool works by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Guiding you to generate a <code>chrome-net-export-log.json</code> file with the correct options (including the crucial step of reloading policies while logging is active to maximize the chance of capturing the configurations).</li>
        <li>Allowing you to upload this log file.</li>
        <li>Parsing the potentially large JSON log file to find specific event entries that contain policy data.</li>
        <li>Identifying and decoding any base64 encoded policy blobs.</li>
        <li>Parsing the decoded policy data (which itself is often JSON) to find a list called <code>NetworkConfigurations</code>.</li>
        <li>Extracting and displaying details for each configured WiFi network found, such as SSID, security type (e.g., WPA-PSK, WPA-EAP), and any available credentials (like a pre-shared key/passphrase, or EAP identity and settings).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It's important to note that for EAP (Enterprise) networks, this tool will typically show configuration parameters (like EAP method, identity, server CA certificate info) rather than the user's actual password, as those are usually not stored or transmitted in a directly extractable way.</p>

    <h4>Step A: Generate and Save the <code>chrome-net-export-log.json</code> File</h4>
    <p>Follow these steps carefully on your ChromeOS device:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open a new tab and navigate to <code>chrome://net-export</code>.</li>
        <li>Under the "OPTIONS" section, ensure you select <strong>"Include raw bytes (includes cookies and credentials)"</strong>.
            <br><span class="warning">Warning:</span> This option captures sensitive data. Only proceed if you understand the implications and are handling the log file securely. Do NOT select "Include private information from all users" unless absolutely necessary and you are certain of the privacy implications.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>"Start Logging to Disk"</strong> button. You will be prompted to save a file; it will typically be named <code>chrome-net-export-log.json</code>. Choose a location to save it.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep the <code>chrome://net-export</code> tab open and logging.</strong> Open another new tab and navigate to <code>chrome://policy</code>.</li>
        <li>On the <code>chrome://policy</code> page, click the <strong>"Reload policies"</strong> button. Wait a few seconds for the policies to refresh. This step is crucial for ensuring current network policies are captured in the log.</li>
        <li>Go back to the <code>chrome://net-export</code> tab and click the <strong>"Stop Logging"</strong> button.</li>
        <li>You now have the <code>chrome-net-export-log.json</code> file saved in the location you chose.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step B: Upload and Analyze the Log</h4>
    <div class="extractor-tool-section nppe-tool">
        <label for="net_export_log_input">Upload your saved <code>chrome-net-export-log.json</code> file:</label>
        <input type="file" id="net_export_log_input" accept=".json">
        <div class="tool-output-container">
            <h4>Output (Network Policy Extractor):</h4>
            <table id="nppe_output_table">
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>SSID</th>
                  <th>Credentials / Details</th>
                  <th>Security</th>
                  <th>HiddenSSID</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <pre id="nppe_log_output" style="font-size: 0.8em; margin-top:10px; max-height: 150px;">Upload a log file to see results.</pre>
        </div>
        <p style="font-size:0.85em; color:#aaa; margin-top:10px;">Note: For EAP networks, 'Credentials / Details' will show configuration parameters (like EAP method, identity) rather than a user-specific password.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Troubleshooting (Both Tools)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Data Found:</strong> If a tool doesn't find anything, it means the WiFi information isn't stored or accessible via that specific method on your device configuration or ChromeOS version. The network might be configured in a way that isn't captured by these techniques (e.g., manual setup without sync, or policies not logged as expected).</li>
      <li><strong>Errors During Extraction:</strong> Ensure you copied the entire, correct JSON data for Tool 1, or uploaded the correct, unaltered log file for Tool 2. The structure of ChromeOS internal data or logs can change with updates, which might occasionally break these tools until they are adapted.</li>
      <li><strong>Tool 1 Specific - SSID Hex Encoding:</strong> If you manually search in `chrome://sync-internals` and your SSID has special characters, direct searching might be tricky. Using the "Get Helper ID" feature in Step A is recommended.</li>
      <li><strong>Tool 2 Specific - Log File Size:</strong> <code>chrome-net-export-log.json</code> files can be very large. The tool processes it in your browser, which might be slow on less powerful devices. Ensure you stop logging reasonably quickly after reloading policies to keep the file size manageable.</li>
    </ul>
